# AnimeCanvas

This website is a personal project created to explore the world of animations in web development, using SCSS for styling and GSAP for animation effects. Currently, the website features just a login form, but the plan is to expand it with exciting artistic-related content in the future.

## Technologies

-SCSS: Leverage the power of SCSS to craft styles that resonate with artistic expression.

-GSAP: Weave enchanting animations into the fabric of your design using the GreenSock Animation Platform.
